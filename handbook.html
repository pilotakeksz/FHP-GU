        <h3>1.11 Resignations and Reinstatements</h3>
        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h4>Base Rules</h4>
        <p>
          You must hold the minimum rank of <span class="rank-badge rank-badge-lr"><span class="rank-text">@𝐅𝐇𝐏 𝐆𝐡𝐨𝐬𝐭 | Senior Trooper</span></span> to be eligible for <span class="rank-badge rank-badge-lr"><span class="rank-text">@𝐅𝐇𝐏 𝐆𝐡𝐨𝐬𝐭 | Veteran Trooper</span></span>. Any and all ranks below will not receive the veteran role when retiring.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will not be eligible for retirement if: you have been warned less than 24 hours ago, striked less than 48 hours ago, or demoted less than a week ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are demoted you will no longer be eligible for any former role. (Only applies to reinstated troopers.)
        </p>
        <p>
    
        </p>
        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h4><span class="rank-badge rank-badge-lr"><span class="rank-text">@𝐅𝐇𝐏 𝐆𝐡𝐨𝐬𝐭 | Low Rank</span></span></h4>
        <p>
          Upon reinstatement, you will no longer be eligible for <span class="rank-badge rank-badge-lr"><span class="rank-text">@𝐅𝐇𝐏 𝐆𝐡𝐨𝐬𝐭 | Veteran Trooper</span></span>. You will need to rank up to High Rank in order to gain eligibility.
        </p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h4><span class="rank-badge rank-badge-hr"><span class="rank-text">@𝐅𝐇𝐏 𝐆𝐡𝐨𝐬𝐭 | High Rank</span></span></h4>
        <p>
          Upon reinstatement, you will no longer be eligible for <span class="rank-badge rank-badge-hr"><span class="rank-text">@𝐅𝐇𝐏 𝐆𝐡𝐨𝐬𝐭 | Former HR</span></span>; you will be required to rank up to Senior High Rank to gain eligibility.
        </p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h4><span class="rank-badge rank-badge-shr"><span class="rank-text">@𝐅𝐇𝐏 𝐆𝐡𝐨𝐬𝐭 | Senior High Rank</span></span></h4>
        <p>
          Any Senior High Rank who reinstates, is required to be an employee for a minimum of 2 months to gain eligibility for <span class="rank-badge rank-badge-shr"><span class="rank-text">@𝐅𝐇𝐏 𝐆𝐡𝐨𝐬𝐭 | Former SHR</span></span>.
        </p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h4><span class="rank-badge rank-badge-1"><span class="rank-text">@𝐅𝐇𝐏 𝐆𝐡𝐨𝐬𝐭 | High Command</span></span></h4>
        <p>
          Any High Command who reinstates, is required to be an employee for a minimum of 2.5 months to gain eligibility for <span class="rank-badge rank-badge-1"><span class="rank-text">@𝐅𝐇𝐏 𝐆𝐡𝐨𝐬𝐭 | Former HICOM</span></span>.
        </p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>
          If any brackets are full—for example, Senior High Rank is full—you will be placed into a bracket below it. You will still have the possibility to gain your prior former role if you follow its requirement. So in this case, you would need to be HR for 2 months minimum.
